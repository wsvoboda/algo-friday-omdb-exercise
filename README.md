### Setting Up Project
1. Fork this repo
2. Run the command: npm i
#### Note: if your terminal throws errors, delete the ****package-lock.json**** file and rerun: npm i
3. Debug errors specifically in MoviePage.js(total errors: 7) and MovieCard.js(total errors: 1)



### Easy
1. Your boss, want to keep a User's name in a global state variable to use in other components. Create a way to change the name of the default User in the sub-heading on the main page by using Redux.

### Medium
1. Your project manager is planning on adding more pages to the project. He/She/They is asking you to refactor 
   the loading state on the MoviePage component so that it can be used globally throughout the project.
   
### Hard
1. Create a MoviesList page.
2. Set up React Router
3. Implement a button to each movie card in MoviePage.js so that a user can add a movie to a list. This list of movies will be displayed on the MovieList Page by using Redux.
